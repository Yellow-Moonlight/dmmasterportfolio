                        On the planet MBJ-23A, 100,000 light-years away from Earth, aliens live.
                        The planets they inhabit have become uninhabitable due to environmental pollution.
                        Now, they want to move to another planet. To do so, they intend to wipe out humanity and turn
                        Earth into a battlefield for themselves.
                        They have used a method to take over other planets by encouraging the aliens living there to
                        destroy themselves.
                        Now, they are trying to use the same strategy on Earth.<br><br>
                        The overall visual design was inspired by a maze. You can find the rules below.

                        - They can manipulate their dice rolls.<br>
                        - During the day, they try to hide their true identity.<br><br>

                        <b>Team Humanity</b><br>
                        - At night, one of them may fall victim to the Aliens.<br>
                        - This player is eliminated from the game.<br>
                        - The remaining humans meet each morning to identify the Aliens on Earth.<br>
                        - After discussion, they choose one player to eliminate.<br>
                        - If a player is eliminated through discussion, no player can be eliminated the next day. (But
                        discussion is still allowed.)<br><br>
                        * The Normal Human<br>
                        - Has no special abilities. Must closely observe others’ behavior to identify the Aliens. Should
                        use their full powers of persuasion to avoid suspicion.<br><br>

                        After learning an identity, the Detective cannot investigate again for two nights.<br><br>

                        <b>Team Climate Activist</b><br>
                        - At night, they can give an Eco Token to one player.<br>
                        - Any human or detective who receives the Eco Token becomes part of the Climate Activist
                        team.<br>

                        * The Scientist<br>
                        At night, the Scientist can check whether a dice roll was manipulated.
                        After checking, they cannot investigate again the following night.<br><br>

                        <b>GAME FLOW</b><br><br>
                        <b>Preparation</b><br>
                        Players choose a game master. The game master is either elected or chosen at random. This person
                        does not play but guides the others through the game. For your first games, it is best if
                        someone familiar with the rules takes on this role and sets the mood appropriately.
                        The game master shuffles the role cards and secretly distributes one to each player. Each player
                        looks at their card and places it face down in front of them.

                        <br><br>
                        <b>Game Rounds</b><br>
                        1. The game begins in the morning.<br>
                        The game master wakes the players with:
                        "Morning dawns and the Earth awakens. All humans wake up, except..."
                        If the Aliens have murdered someone, the game master announces the victim. That player reveals
                        their role card and is eliminated from the game. They may no longer communicate with the other
                        players.
                        If the victim is the Climate Activist, the game master says:
                        "The Alien tried to kill the Climate Activist, but failed."<br><br>

                        2. Daytime discussion begins.<br>
                        Players discuss who might be the Alien.<br>
                        The game master moderates the discussion, in which all remaining players participate.<br>
                        During the discussion phase, the Climate Activist may try to convince another player to accept
                        an Eco Token and join the Climate Activist team.<br><br>

                        3. The village votes.<br>
                        Players vote on who they believe is an Alien and should be eliminated.<br>
                        On the game master’s signal, everyone points to another player at the same time. The player with
                        the most votes is eliminated.<br>
                        If there is a tie, players vote again. If there is still a tie, no one is eliminated that day.
                        An eliminated player reveals their role and may no longer speak.<br><br>

                        4. Evening phase.<br>
                        An action card is drawn. These cards show the dice color and any modifiers (increases or
                        decreases) to the dice result.<br>
                        The game master randomly chooses a player to draw a card. Dice rolling proceeds clockwise from
                        that player.<br><br>

                        5. The village goes to sleep.<br>
                        The game master announces sleep. All players close their eyes. Then the game master calls the
                        different roles in turn.
                        Important: Only the role being called opens their eyes. All others keep their eyes
                        closed.<br><br>

                        6. Dice roll.<br>
                        The game master calls on the player who drew the action card:<br>
                        "Roll the dice."<br>
                        However, Aliens and Climate Activists may manipulate the dice result.<br><br>

                        7. The Scientist phase.<br>
                        The game master says:<br>
                        "The Scientist awakens. Do you want to check if the dice result was manipulated?"<br>
                        The Scientist opens their eyes and indicates their intent by nodding or shaking their head.<br>
                        If they choose to check, the game master confirms with an O (yes) or X (no), then says:<br>
                        "The Scientist goes back to sleep."<br><br>

                        8. The Detective phase.<br>
                        The game master says:<br>
                        "The Detective awakens. Would you like to identify someone?"<br>
                        The Detective opens their eyes and points to a player.<br>
                        The game master shows them that player’s role card. Then:<br>
                        "The Detective goes back to sleep."<br><br>

                        9. The Alien phase.<br>
                        The game master says:<br>
                        "The Aliens awaken. Would you like to murder someone?"<br>
                        The Aliens open their eyes, silently choose a victim together.<br>
                        Then: "The Aliens go back to sleep."<br><br>

                        10. Starting from the third night – Climate Activist phase.<br>
                        The game master says:<br>
                        "The Climate Activist awakens. Would you like to give someone an Eco Token?"<br>
                        The Climate Activist opens their eyes and points to a player.<br>
                        The game master places an Eco Token on that player. Then:<br>
                        "The Climate Activist goes back to sleep."<br><br>

                        11. A new morning begins.<br>
                        The game master announces:<br>
                        "Morning dawns and the Earth awakens. All humans wake up, except..."<br>
                        The next round begins, starting again from step 1.<br><br>

                        <b>VICTORY CONDITIONS</b><br><br>
                        The Alien Team wins if all players from the Humanity Team and the Climate Activist Team have
                        been eliminated, or if the total sum of all dice rolls exceeds 40.<br>

                        The Humanity Team wins if all Aliens are eliminated before the total dice roll sum exceeds 40.<br>

                        The Climate Activist Team wins if they successfully distribute Eco Tokens to all players before
                        the total dice roll sum exceeds 40.<br><br>

                        <b>SCORING</b><br><br>
                        After 8 games, points are calculated to determine the final rankings:<br><br>
                        <b>If the Alien Team wins:</b><br>
